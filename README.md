# Description

This is a jupyter notebook in which we have classified the credit card frauds in this exercise. 
The Logistic Regression algorithm is used along with standard scaler and pca for dimensionality reduction.We need to reduce the number of False Negatives. i.e. transactions which are fraud but are predicted as OK.
Also, we have used grid search cv for selecting best parameters.
